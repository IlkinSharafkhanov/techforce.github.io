        <p class="process"> First of all, we started our journey by looking for the school where we are going to hold our project. We discussed, searched, and decided to choose school No264, which, Ilkin Sharafkhan graduated from with academic distinction. After, Ilkin went to school and talked with guidance. They gracefully accepted our request and promised us to help with everything that we need. At first, we were four participants in the group, but Nahid told us that he is not going to participate, so there are just three participants.
            Later, we divided the topics between each other, and everybody started to work on the area in which he can do better. For example, Ilkin and Gunay are making the presentation that they are going to present to the students, and Fidan is writing the report which is required. We are meeting 3 times a week and working together for more than two hours to make and produce the project as marvelous as we can do. 
            We worked on the presentation for 2 weeks, brainstormed, and debated together, and right after we finished making the presentation, we opened it on the smartboard and started practicing. We practiced talking and explaining the information in front of the smartboard, as we will talk to the audience because we needed to improve our self-confidence and reliance. 
            During the preparations, all of us learned how to work as a team, give decisions together, respect each otherâ€™s opinions. Despite that the task was complex, we broke it into parts and steps and successfully managed to plan the time. Working together enabled us to pool our ideas and see the problem from different perspectives, and it led to completing the task perfectly.</p>
