             <p> After midterms, Araz Muallim separated us to the teams, and as team34 we had to find each other. We all got together with the help of phone numbers in WhatsApp group but unfortunately, at the beginning we could not reach to one of our team member. After two weeks he informed us that he could not join us because of other courses. So, we continued three of us to the teamwork.Our team’s name has interesting history that belongs to us. We all are Marvel fans and X– Force is one of the Marvel universe's team. The X-Force is a fictional superhero team that has appeared in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most often in conjunction with the X-Men. While conversation we realized that we've all read this comic book and we began to discuss about X-Force. In addition, since the beginning of the semester, Araz Muallim calls us special forces of university and in the future IT industry. For these two reasons we decided that we would not find better name than Tech-Force. Being Marvel fans and our common interests also helped us to be good friends, so we enjoyed from this period. We spend so fascinating time while doing Homework. Sometimes we had difficulties about learning Computer Languages from the beginning, but we helped each other. To conclude, this teamwork caused great friendship.</p>
