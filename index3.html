        <h1 class="subtitle">The Process Of Creating the Website</h1>
        <p class="process"> Before starting to write web page we as a team completed course of HTML5 and CSS at Codecademy.com. After gaining knowledge that we need we started to write first page of the web site. It was the hardest part of writing our first webpage as for all of us first experience. The main problems that we had was concerning linking our CSS file to HTML and finding suitable IDE. Although it now it seems very easy we spent one day for solving this problem and changed 2 IDEs (BBEdit, Atom) and finished with using Visual Studio Code. After we got acquainted with the process and adopted it we decided to meet at university and write one page per day. First thing we were deciding while creating web page was its structure. Secondly colors, background picture and content. Only after deciding all of this we were starting to write the code of web page. The whole process took us a week. It was fun, enjoyable and intimidating. Even some of us decided to continue to learn web development in future.</p>
